Task and TaskList will be stateless functional components

Task and TaskList will be stateless functional components, introduced in React v0.14. They don’t have access to lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount, only accept props, don’t use this.state or this.setState, and they’re defined as plain functions instead of with createReactClass or ES2015 classes.

1 Stateless functional components are exported anonymous functions.
2 These components receive and display props from parent components.
